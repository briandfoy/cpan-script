	* Don't give a warning if the user is a Linux weenie who likes
	to type "install". Just ignore it an move on. It's still not
	an approved or documented calling sequence, but it does get
	me a free beer from Adam Kennedy.

1.53 - Sun Apr  6 15:49:50 2008
	* cpan(1) now ignores the first argument if it is "install" and has 
	additional arguments. Previously it gave a warning. Adam Kennedy 
	promised to buy me a beer if I gave him his way, so why not :)

1.53 - Wed Nov  1 15:58:17 2006
	* Added trap to catch people using "install" as the first argument.
	The script just dies telling them not to do that.

1.52 - Thu Jan 26 02:13:05 2006
* Took out an exit() that caused Windows users some problems.
* If you aren't experiencing oddities, you don't need to 
upgrade
* I changed the distro name to cpan-script to distinguish this
from the CPAN module

1.51 - Wed Jan 11 00:25:52 2006
	* bumped the version number which I forgot to do last time. This
	version should get onto CPAN and it fixes the things I noted in
	the previous release

1.6 - Wed Jan  4 14:12:03 2006
	* The -i default behavior disappeared (by mistake) with the
	re-write in the last version. This version fixes RT 16915
	that reports that bug.
	* All users of cpan-1.05 (the script, not the CPAN.pm distro version)
	should upgrade. You can check your cpan(1) version with `cpan -v`

1.5 - Fri Dec 23 16:59:18 2005

	* No need to upgrade unless you want the new features
	* Read the Change files with -C
	* List the authors with -A
	* List extended module details with -D
	* List all modules for authors with -L

1.4 - Tue Jul  6 00:36:51 2004
	* added -f option to permit a "force install"
	* removed File::Find::Rule and Test::File prereqs

1.3 - Thu Dec 12 00:37:31 2002
	* the first distribution with MakeMaker support
	* no changes to the code that comes with CPAN.pm
